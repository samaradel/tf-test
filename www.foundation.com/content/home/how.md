Our technology enables a maximally distributed grid of data and compute capacity, generated by many small nodes owned by individual farmers.

* These nodes are self healing, without needing maintenance by IT specialists, and the grid they create consumes 10x less energy than traditional data centers.
* The Threefold green grid is scalable, sustainable, affordable, and allows people even in areas of the least connectivity to participate in the network.
* The grid promotes prosperity for farmers via the Threefold Token (TFT), a next generation currency 100% backed by the asset of the gridâ€™s data and compute capacity.
