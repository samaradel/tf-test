Data will be the gold of the new digital economy.

The need for data is growing exponentially due to increasing internet use, self-driving cars and the Internet of Things.

The existing global economic model is reaching its limits, excluding many and diminishing finite resources.

To achieve our dream of a more empowered global community, resource-saving technology and a more inclusive economy, our vision is to:

* Decentralize storage and compute capacity, to allow for a maximally distributed, affordable, energy-efficient grid to enable a neutral internet- by all for all.
* Create a next generation currency, which unlike digital currencies to date, is 100% asset backed by the fastest growing commodity today- the internet, and run on a new improved Blockchain.
* Catalyze a community of IT developers, supporters, and responsible global citizens to share in the vision, and to support the development of further value-adding peer-to-peer technologies.

We wanted to do all this as a transparent collective, a responsible digital organization which reflects our core values- so we started the Threefold Foundation.

**Together we are making our dream of a neutral, green distributed internet a reality.**
