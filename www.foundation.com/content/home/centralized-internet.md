## **Centralized internet is inefficient, expensive and wasteful.**

#### Consider electricity:

If consumers in Turkey had to use electricity generated in the USA, it would be expensive and inefficient, because it is generated at too remote a distance.. Transmission lines would be strained, and losses and repairs would make it unsustainable. There would be multiple areas without access to electricity.

**This is exactly what is happening with the internet today.**
