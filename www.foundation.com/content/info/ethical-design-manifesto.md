How to create products in an ethical, human friendly way.

## Respect Human Rights 

* Sustainable = green (our world needs some help).
* Available for all: which also means affordable, not owned by a big company with as purpose greed.
* Decentralised: make sure technology is available everywhere.
* Open &amp; interoperable: allow techno to work together in open way.
* Accessible: easy to access, fast enough, everywhere in the world.
* Secure &amp; private: your privacy is a right.
                            
## Respect Human Effort
                           
* Make sure technology is reliable and lasts longer (no need to replace in 5 years).
* Avoid complexity (KIS): no unnecessary complexity.
* LESS = MORE (do less to achieve more).
* Let people/companies work together in a 100% transparent way.

## Respect Human Experience

* Products should be ergonomic &amp; easy to use.
* Design should be global: don’t favor certain user groups!.
* Products should look good, it will give us a better feeling.
* TRANSPARENT: sales, pricing, processes, …
